- [x] I see this warning /tmp/pi-clipboard-20260217-210651-a5e7ec50-c4b8-473f-a22a-19b33d2627b7.png There is no way to remove it. Can I mark it as seen such that it disappears
- [x] chatting with an article does not work. It does not return a response. I wait a bit and see the dot's moving, but when it stops I see this /tmp/pi-clipboard-20260217-212158-82a595f7-9376-4880-b359-02a2768aef02.png
- [x] Some articles have referenced articles. Can we add this as a link summary next to the post, or below. I need a button to get a summary of that article. We should not do that in advance, but on demand. Maybe open in the site pane like chat with article. It shows the summary and I should be able to talk to the original article with the link we just got combined. 
- [x] The links from an article now also contain images. It should only contain references to other articles or linkedin posts, or X posts etc. Images and video's are not interesting to show
- [x] I want to be able to resize the side panel where I talk to the article. It should open the way it opens now, but I should be able to drag the border to resize it.
- [x] When the robot responds in the side panel with markdown, it should be rendered correctly. Currently it shows plain text: /tmp/pi-clipboard-20260218-105507-1cdd6d95-9769-4b7b-9371-9217a9aaa780.png
- [x] I want to be able to flag a blog and put it on my read later list. The read-later list should be easily available. The blog should have an indicator (like a ribbon, or pin to show that it is saved for later). Clicking the ribbon will then remove the blog post. For read it later it should also show read,unread status toggle
