# Decision Log: Clickable Entry Card
Date: 2026-03-01
Task: Make the entire entry card clickable to navigate to the article

## Problem Statement
Currently, only the title link navigates to the article. The user wants to click
anywhere on the card to open the article, but all interactive elements (buttons,
links, star ratings) must continue to work normally.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Wrap entire card in an <a> tag
- Pros: Semantic, accessible, works with middle-click/right-click
- Cons: Nesting interactive elements (buttons, links) inside <a> is invalid HTML.
  Can cause browser quirks and accessibility issues.

### Option 2: CSS "stretched link" pattern
- Use a pseudo-element on the title link stretched to cover the card via position
- Pros: Semantic link, accessible, valid HTML
- Cons: Inner links/buttons need `position: relative; z-index: 1` to stay above
  the stretched link. Can be tricky with complex card layouts.

### Option 3: onclick handler on the card div with event delegation
- Add an onclick handler to the card <div>
- Check if the click target is within an interactive element (a, button, input, etc.)
- If not, programmatically open the article URL and mark as read
- Pros: Simple, keeps all existing interactive elements working, no HTML nesting issues
- Cons: Not a real <a> tag so no native middle-click/context-menu "open in new tab".
  But this can be mitigated with cursor:pointer styling.

## Decision
**Option 3: onclick handler with event delegation.**

Rationale:
- The card has many interactive elements (star rating, read/unread toggle, bookmark,
  chat button, referenced links, summarize buttons). Using event delegation makes
  it trivial to let these work normally.
- The card already has an explicit "Open article" link at the bottom for users who
  want right-click/middle-click behavior.
- Adding cursor:pointer on the card gives clear visual feedback.
- This approach requires the least code change and has the lowest risk of breaking
  existing functionality.
